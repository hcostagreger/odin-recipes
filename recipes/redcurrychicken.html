    <p>A five ingredient quick red curry chicken.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons coconut oil</li>
            <li>1 (16oz) skinless, boneliess, chicken breast halves cut into small cubes</li>
            <li>1 (14oz) can cream of coconut</li>
            <li>1 (11oz) bottle red Thai curry sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 (16oz) package dried rice noodles</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet on high heat. Add chicken cubes; cook until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Reduce heat to medium-high and add coconut cream and curry sauce. Cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 5 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil; stir in vermicelli pasta and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta is tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Reduce skillet heat to simmer. Add the noodles and let simmer until flavors are absorbed, about 5 minutes. Divide chicken and noodles among individual serving bowls.</li>
    </ol>
