                <li>1 1/2 cups granulated sugar</li>
                <li>4 large eggs</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups all purpose flour</li>
                <li>3/4 cups almond flour</li>
                <li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li>
                <li>pinch of salt</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon almond extract</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
                <li>3/4 cup canola oil</li>
            </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350˚F (175˚C). Spray a 9-inch round cake pan (with at least 2 inch tall sides) with baking spray. Line bottom of pan with parchment paper and spray parchment paper lightly. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Place almonds in a small baking pan. Spread to a single layer. Bake for 15 minutes or until just beginning to turn pale golden brown, stirring every 5 minutes. Remove from oven and set aside to cool (these will be used at the end to top the cake).</li>
                <li>Combine the orange zest, orange juice, powdered sugar and extracts in a small bowl for the glaze. Stir with a whisk until smooth. Cover and set aside.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, combine the yogurt, sugar, and eggs, stirring until well blended.</li>
                <li>Add the all-purpose flour, almond flour, baking powder, salt and extracts. Stir to combine.</li>
                <li>Add the oil and stir well. Don't worry, at first it will seem to separate, but keep stirring till smooth. This might take 2-3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Pour the batter into prepared pan. Bake for 35-45 minutes, until the cake feels springy to the touch in the center and a toothpick or cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean. Cover loosely with foil if getting too brown near the end and cake is still not done*. Be careful not to over bake. Cool cake on a wire rack for 10 minutes; then turn it out of the pan onto the rack.</li>
                <li>While the cake is still warm, using a pastry brush, gently pat the glaze all over the cake. Just keep going over the cake till the glaze is gone. Some of it will drip off, but most of it will soak in. Sprinkle the toasted almonds over the top of cake while glaze is wet and pat gently. Allow cake to cool completely. Sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve.</li>          
            </ol>
